## Upgrade Tips

### Do's
- **Spend early** - Upgrades compound over waves
- **Prioritize damage** - It affects all weapons
- **Balance offense and defense** - Pure glass cannon is risky
- **Consider weapon choice** - Fire rate less useful for Sniper

### Don'ts
- **Don't save too much** - Unspent points are wasted potential
- **Don't spread too thin** - Focus on key stats
- **Don't skip damage** - It's universally useful
- **Don't ignore movement** - Mobility is survival

---

## Multiplayer Considerations

In co-op:
- Each player has separate upgrades
- Consider team composition
- One tank + one glass cannon works well
- Communicate upgrade plans

## Stat Calculations

### Damage Formula
```
Final Damage = Base Damage × (1 + 0.10 × Damage Level)
```

Example: Level 5 Damage with Assault Rifle (base 25)
```
25 × (1 + 0.10 × 5) = 25 × 1.5 = 37.5 damage
```

### Health Formula
```
Final Health = 100 + (15 × Health Level)
```

Example: Level 6 Max Health
```
100 + (15 × 6) = 190 HP
```

### Movement Speed Formula
```
Final Speed = Base Speed × (1 + 0.05 × Speed Level)
```
