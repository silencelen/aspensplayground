Master the game with these pro tips and strategies.

---

## Beginner Tips

### The Basics

1. **Keep moving** - A moving target is harder to hit
2. **Aim for the head** - 1.5x damage on all weapons
3. **Don't reload in danger** - Switch weapons instead
4. **Use the whole map** - Don't get cornered
5. **Learn zombie sounds** - Audio cues save lives

### Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It's Bad | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| Standing still | Easy target | Circle-strafe while shooting |
| Reloading mid-fight | Vulnerable for 2+ seconds | Switch to pistol instead |
| Ignoring Spitters | Chip damage adds up | Prioritize ranged enemies |
| Fighting close to Exploders | 50 damage explosion | Kill from distance |
| Skipping upgrades | Falling behind scaling | Spend points every wave |

## Movement Strategies

### Kiting

Kiting means moving away while shooting backwards.

```
YOU ←←← SHOOTING ←←← ZOMBIES FOLLOWING
```

**How to kite:**
1. Face the zombies
2. Walk backwards (S key)
3. Shoot while retreating
4. Turn and sprint if they get close
5. Repeat from a new angle

### Circle Strafing

For single tough enemies (Tanks, Bosses):

```
        ↑
    ←  ENEMY  →
        ↓
     YOU (circling)
```

- Move perpendicular to the enemy
- Keep shooting while strafing
- Enemy turns slowly, misses attacks
- Perfect for boss fights

### The Funnel

When overwhelmed, use terrain:

```
ZOMBIES → [NARROW GAP] → YOU (shooting into funnel)
```

- Find a doorway or narrow passage
- Back through it
- Zombies line up single-file
- Easier to shoot, harder to surround you

## Combat Strategies

### Threat Prioritization

Kill in this order:

1. **Exploders** (close range) - Kill before they reach you
2. **Spitters** - Stop the ranged damage
3. **Runners** - Fast, can flank
4. **Tanks** - Slow but deadly
5. **Crawlers** - Moderate threat
6. **Normal** - Lowest priority

### Ammo Conservation

- **Pistol** has infinite reserve - use it for stragglers
- **Headshots** save 2-3 bullets per zombie
- **Don't spray** - controlled bursts are more efficient
- **Switch weapons** instead of reloading in emergencies

### Weapon Pairing

| Situation | Primary | Secondary |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| General waves | Assault Rifle | Shotgun |
| Boss fights | Laser Gun | Sniper Rifle |
| Late game | Laser Gun | Grenade Launcher |
| Ammo crisis | Pistol | SMG |

## Boss Fight Strategies

### General Boss Tips

1. **Clear the wave first** - Boss waves have normal zombies too
2. **Full health before engaging** - You'll need it
3. **Save grenades** - Use during safe windows
4. **Don't get greedy** - Back off when attacks come

### Attack Windows

| After This Attack | Safe Window |
|-------------------|-------------|
| Ground Slam | 2-3 seconds |
| Charge (missed) | 1-2 seconds |
| Summon | 3-4 seconds |

### Phase Transitions

Bosses get more aggressive at:
- 66% HP (Phase 2)
- 33% HP (Phase 3)

**Slow down in Phase 3** - Don't die to an enraged boss!

See [Boss Fights](Boss-Fights) for detailed strategies.

## Map Awareness

### Key Locations

Know your map:
- **Open areas** - Good for kiting
- **Chokepoints** - Good for funneling
- **Health spawn locations** - For emergencies
- **Corners** - AVOID (you'll get trapped)

### Spawn Points

- Zombies spawn from fixed locations
- Learn where they come from
- Position between spawn points, not near them

### Escape Routes

Always have TWO exits:
- Primary escape path
- Backup if primary is blocked
