### 3. Shop Phase
After each wave, the upgrade shop opens for 15 seconds:
- Spend points to upgrade your stats
- Upgrades persist through the game
- Choose wisely - you can't undo purchases!

### 4. Next Wave
Waves get progressively harder:
- More zombies spawn
- Zombies have more health and damage
- New zombie types appear
- Every 10 waves, a boss appears!

## Combat Tips for Beginners

### Movement is Key
- Never stand still while fighting
- Circle-strafe around zombie groups
- Use the environment to create distance

### Aim for the Head
- Headshots deal **1.5x damage**
- The crosshair turns red on hit
- Practice on slower zombies first

### Manage Your Ammo
- Reload when there's a break in combat
- Don't waste bullets on dying zombies
- Switch weapons if you run out mid-fight

### Know When to Run
- Getting surrounded = death
- Sprint to create distance
- Jump over low obstacles

---

## Understanding Zombie Types

### Early Waves (1-3)
Only **Normal Zombies** - slow and predictable. Use these waves to practice aiming.

### Mid Waves (4-9)
- **Runners** - Fast but weak, they leap at you
- **Crawlers** - Low to the ground, harder to hit
- **Tanks** - Slow but very tough, they charge

### Later Waves (10+)
- **Spitters** - Ranged attackers, stay mobile
- **Exploders** - Explode on death, keep distance
- **Bosses** - Every 10 waves, massive health and damage

---

## Wave 10: Your First Boss

At wave 10, you'll face **THE ABOMINATION**:

- Massive health pool (1500+ HP)
- Three attack patterns
- Spawns minions at low health
- Drops guaranteed pickups on death

**Strategy:**
1. Stay mobile - never stop moving
2. Avoid the ground slam AoE (red circle warning)
3. Don't get caught by charges
4. Kill minions quickly
5. Use grenades when safe

1. Your score is submitted to the leaderboard
