- May summon more minions

### Phase 3 (Below 33% HP)
- Much faster attacks (0.6x cooldowns)
- Extremely aggressive
- Frequent minion summons

## Boss Fight Strategy

### Preparation (Before Wave 10)

1. **Upgrade Priority:**
   - Max damage on your main weapon
   - Reload speed for less downtime
   - Movement speed helps with dodging

2. **Weapon Selection:**
   - Primary: Laser Gun (sustained damage) or Assault Rifle
   - Secondary: Sniper Rifle for safe damage
   - Have grenades ready

3. **Health:**
   - Enter the fight at full health
   - Save health pickups from wave 9 if possible

---

### During the Fight

#### Opening Phase
1. Establish distance - don't fight up close
2. Identify the attack pattern
3. Start dealing sustained damage

#### Damage Windows
- **After Ground Slam**: Boss recovers briefly
- **After Charge**: Boss slows to turn around
- **During Summon**: Boss is stationary

#### Continuous Movement
- Never stop moving
- Circle the boss at medium range
- Keep the arena in view (don't get cornered)

#### Managing Minions
- Kill them during boss cooldowns
- Use AoE to clear groups
- Don't let them pile up

### Recommended Loadout

| Slot | Weapon | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| Primary | Laser Gun | Sustained damage while mobile |
| Secondary | Assault Rifle | Reliable backup |
| Tertiary | Sniper Rifle | Safe long-range damage |
| Equipment | Grenades (3) | Minion clear / burst damage |

## Boss Rewards

Defeating a boss grants:

| Reward | Amount |

## Multiplayer Boss Strategy

In co-op:
- **Assign roles**: One player kites, others deal damage
- **Split attention**: Boss can only target one player
- **Revive priority**: Keep all players alive
- **Minion duty**: Designate someone for minion control
- **Call out attacks**: Warn teammates of charge direction

---

## Common Mistakes

1. **Fighting too close** - Boss melee hurts
2. **Ignoring minions** - They overwhelm you
3. **Panic during Phase 3** - Stay calm, keep moving
4. **Not using grenades** - They're meant for this
5. **Tunnel vision** - Watch the whole arena
6. **Getting cornered** - Always have an escape route
